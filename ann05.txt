Subject: [ANN] CLORB 0.5 - A Common Lisp implementation of CORBA

I have put version 0.5 of CLORB on Source Forge. CLORB is an
implementation of CORBA 2 in Common Lisp.

<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/clorb/>


New in 0.5:

   * Valuetype (object by value) including Abstract interface.
   * New idl parser
   * Improved ports
   * New stub and skeleton implementation

Ports:

   MCL 5        only tested with Max OS X native
   OpenMCL      seems to work (Mac OS X)
   SBCL         seems to work on Mac OS X and Debian GNU/Linux (i386)
   CLISP        works again (2.32)
