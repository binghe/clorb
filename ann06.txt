Subject: [ANN] CLORB 0.6 - A Common Lisp implementation of CORBA

I have put version 0.6 of CLORB on Source Forge. CLORB is an
implementation of CORBA 2 in Common Lisp.

<URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/clorb/>


New in 0.6:

   * IIOP 1.1
   * ASDF support
   * IDL compiler improvments (fixed literals and constants, escaped chars
     in string literals) 

Ports:

   MCL 5        only tested with Max OS X native
   OpenMCL      working (Mac OS X)
   SBCL         working on Mac OS X and Debian GNU/Linux (i386)
   CLISP        works again (2.32)
   CMUCL        working with 19a on Mac OS X and Debian GNU/Linux (i386)
